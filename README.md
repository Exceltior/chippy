# Chippy

Chippy is a little side project I'm starting to learn more about emulation. I will be building a [CHIP-8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CHIP-8) vm that runs CHIP-8 public domain roms. The Chip 8 actually never was a real system, but more like a virtual machine (VM) developed in the 70â€™s by Joseph Weisbecker. Games written in the Chip 8 language could easily run on systems that had a Chip 8 interpreter.
